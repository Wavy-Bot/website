# Wavy website

This is the Wavy website & dashboard combo website. It is written in Next.js (which is a framework around React) allowing it to feel very snappy whilst enabling traditional SEO options.

## For maintainers

For those looking to maintain this codebase here are some of the basic things you'll need to know:

* We use yarn here, since it offers caching for dependencies. If you do not have yarn installed you can install it by running `npm i yarn -g` on your system.
* This website is written in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. This means that it is fully compatible with JavaScript but also adds a lot of extra features. If you are not familiar with TypeScript you can read more about it [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


## Running locally

After cloning / pulling the repository you should install the dependencies using `yarn`. Once that is done you can run the development server using `yarn dev`. This will start a development server on port 3000. You can access the website by going to `http://localhost:3000`.
